**Observables**

```
Can be thought of initially as a data source.

In an angular Project an Observable is an Object
we import from a third party package(rxjs)

An Observable can be triggerred from User Input,Events,
Http Request, or triggerred om code.

Critical also in Observable patter in an Observer.

In between the Observable and the Observer we have a
Stream(Timeline)

We can have mutiple data packages in between emmitted
and thats what the Observable listens.

We have the Observable which emits data and we
have the Observer(For example your code when you
subscribe)

There are three hooks that an Observable can tap:
(a)Handle Data-->How i have been receiving data for example
   route info from activateRoute

(b)An Observable can also implement Handle Error.

(c)An Observable can also implement handle Completion.

Eg after making a HTTP Request.

We use Observables to Handle asychoronous task.

You do not know when they will happen or how long it will take.

Its a different approach on handling asychoronous tasks.

It is a different approach for Async data which angular embrances.
