Learning how to build out own  custom directives

There are three types of directives in Angular Js:

(a)Components—directives with a template.

(b)Structural directives—change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.

(They affect the Whole area in the DOM.A good example in ngIf and ngFor)

(c)Attribute directives—change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.(Only affect or change the element which they are added to)

N/B You cannot combine tow structural directives together.
