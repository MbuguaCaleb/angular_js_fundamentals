**Learning Angular Forms**

```
Angular helps us in managing our forms eg

(a)Checking what the User Entered.


(b)Checking whether the form is Valid

Angular helps us by giving to my Ts file a Javascript represenatation of
my form making it easy to retrieve User values and to see the state of the
form.

With the JSON Representation i can be able to do Validations, ect

```

**Template Driven vs Reactive Approach**

```
Angular gives us two approaches when it comes to handling forms

(a)Template Driven

Angular infers the form Object from the DOM.


(b)Reactive Approach

The form is created programatically and synschronized with the DOM.

You define the form in the Ts file but also declare it in your template.
